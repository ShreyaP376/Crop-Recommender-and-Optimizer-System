Crop-Recommender-and-Optimizer-System

Data science project which includes data preprocessing, analyzing and model builiding for crop recommendation based on climatic features.
Algorithm used is K-Means clustering.
Prepared a crop recommendation system using machine learning algorithms to assist farmers in their crop selection.
Implemented a collaborative filtering approach to personalize crop recommendations based on individual farm characteristics and preference, resulting in 96% accuracy.

Requirements: 
Dataset containing info on the levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in soil, as well as temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall, and their impact on the growth of crops.

Workflow:
1. Data collection and loading
2. Distribution of agricultural condition based on different parameters.
3. Identifying seasonal crops
4. Clustering the data using kmeans clustering
5. Splitting data into training and splitting part
6. Training logistics regression model 
7. Predicting on test data
